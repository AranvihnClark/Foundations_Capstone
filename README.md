# Joe The Guard
A short RPG game where you, the user, will act as Joe, the guard, in a single day of his life. While taking care of your own problems, you will determine if travelers coming into the Kingdom of Gloria are safe or if they are detrimental to your Kingdom. You may not live the most exciting life, but you are the only one to stop criminals from entering and wreaking havoc in the capital.

Joe The Guard is a button click game created by me, Aranvihn Clark, where you will determine Joe's action based on the time of day and who it is that tries to enter the Kingdom. This web app was created as part a Capstone Project during a Brightpaths cohort. The base product was the result of a little over a week of work. I hope to continue to build this project in my spare time and expand further upon the features already present.
